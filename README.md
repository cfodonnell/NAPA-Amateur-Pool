# Napa-Amateur-Pool

A project to study the factors which influence the outcomes of amateur pool matches. All data was sourced from the North American Poolshooters Association (NAPA) website, www.napaleagues.com.

Data was collected via web scraping, with a database of individual player profiles, *players_with_skills.csv*, created using the files *get_player_data.ipynb* and *get_player_skills.ipynb*.

For a full description of the project, see the file Discussion.pdf.
